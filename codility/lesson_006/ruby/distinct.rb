Write a function

  def solution(a)

that, given an array A consisting of N integers, returns the number of distinct values in array A.

For example, given array A consisting of six elements such that:

  A[0] = 2    A[1] = 1    A[2] = 1
  A[3] = 2    A[4] = 3    A[5] = 1

the function should return 3, because there are 3 distinct values appearing in array A, namely 1, 2 and 3.

Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

  - N is an integer within the range [0..100,000];
  - each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’1,000,000..1,000,000].

Results:

  - Test score: 100%
  - Correctness: 100%
  - Performance: 100%
